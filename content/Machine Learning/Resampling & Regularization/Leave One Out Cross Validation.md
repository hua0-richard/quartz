Special Case of [[K-fold Cross Validation]].

$k = N$ where $N$ is the number of data points in the dataset.

Steps
1. Split the dataset into $N$ folds.
2. In each iteration $1$ point is used as the [[Validation Set]]. The remaining $N - 1$ points are used as the [[ Train Set|Training Set]].

### Pros
Less Bias
Deterministic
General

### Cons
Computationally Demanding
More Variance
