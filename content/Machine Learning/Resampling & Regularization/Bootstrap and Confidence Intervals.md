Using $B$ bootstrap samples to estimate $\alpha$ results in  a sampling distribution for the estimator $\hat{\alpha}$.

Now, that we have the [[Sampling Distribution |sampling distribution]] for $\hat{\alpha}$ , finding the confidence interval is a matter of determining the appropriate percentiles.
