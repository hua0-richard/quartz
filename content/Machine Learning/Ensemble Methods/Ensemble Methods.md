[[Boosting]]

Techniques which combine the predictions of multiple models to improve overall predictive performance.

### Types of Ensemble Methods

1. Parallel Learners. Multiple Models are trained independently of each other.
2. Sequential Learners. Models are trained in sequence (one after another). Each model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous model.
